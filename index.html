        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Hey - I'm Alexis, and I'm picking up some coding skills. I've been workign in tech across data 
            analysis and product manage for 5 years, and am now learning to productionise some cool stuff.</p>
        <br>
        <p>I'm from <a href="https://wikipedia.com/liechtenstein">a tiny place</a> you've
        probably never been to - I don't blame you. Anyhow, education brought me to Scotland and London where I currently work (at home, like all of us).</p>
        <br>
        <p>Here's a list of projects and learnings which I'm picking up throughout Lockdown, I hope they'll become useful at some point
            and will help me track my progress - thanks for checking it out!</p>
